This is a project website for my class of a real local company in my city. 
This website is an example of work we can provide for the company as software engineers.
In this case i (Luis Beltran) am the project manager but due to the lack of coding experience from my fellow classmates, i had to take a leading role in developing our site.

This was made using Angular.

Here is some screenshots of the page itself:
